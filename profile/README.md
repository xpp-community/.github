# XPP Community

Welcome to the XPP Community RWS account specifically designed to distribute and share examples for all XPP users. The content of this account must adhere to the RWS Community Terms and Conditions outlined here: https://www.rws.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/community-terms-conditions/

The purpose of this account is to share:

- XPP JOB examples
- Tools/Utilities that may be universally valuable to any XPP user

## Job Example Repositories

All repositories within xpp-community that present XPP Job examples are prefixed with JOB_. 

## Tools/Utilities/Miscellaneous Repositories

All repositories within xpp-community that are specific to a tool, script, etc. do not have the same prefix naming syntax. 

### Graphics

In order to view graphics that are included with these sample jobs, you will need to make sure your Graphics Configuration is set correctly. To verify, do the following.
Launch the XPP Administrative Tools. From the Administrative Tools, click File -> Graphics Configuration. 

Create a new rule. In the Library Name field, type "graphics". In the Library Path field, type ../graphics. This instructs XPP to look for a folder named
graphics in the current JOB directory. Store and exit from the Graphics Configuration, and you can also close the Administrative Tools application.
